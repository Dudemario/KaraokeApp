00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
I need feeling you on me And I guess in a way you do

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
All my breath on revelin' emotions I need some space to think this through

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Call me all night long Try to give you hints in a hard to see

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
Right on the line, no Losing it on you is the last thing I need

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
If I'm honest, I'll just make you cry And I don't wanna fight with you

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
I would rather lie to you But if I'm honest, now's not the right time
